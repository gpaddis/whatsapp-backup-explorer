# WhatsApp Backup Explorer
The database schema was generated with `rails db:schema:dump`. Some tables had to be dumped manually, since the command does not automatically recognize some of the fields in WhatsApp's SQLite database.

The models were autogenerated with [schema_to_scaffold](https://github.com/frenesim/schema_to_scaffold).

## Usage
WhatsApp stores your encrypted messages and media files in the directory `WhatsApp` on your android device. You will need these files to explore the backup.

### 1. Database
First, you need the decrypted `msgstore.db` file to explore the archive. Here's how you get it:
1. If you have root access to your current Android phone, just extract the file from the WhatsApp data directory.
2. If you don't have root access to your current phone, you can extract the file containing encryption key from any older phone where you had another Whatsapp installation and decrypt the msgstore.db.crypt12 file generated for your Google Drive backup (usually stored in the SD card: /WhatsApp/Databases) with a tool like [WhatsApp-Crypt12-Decrypter](https://github.com/EliteAndroidApps/WhatsApp-Crypt12-Decrypter).
3. If you don't have root access to *any* of your phones, you can still extract the encryption key with an Android emulator using a tool called [WhatsDump](https://github.com/MarcoG3/WhatsDump).

Once you have the decrypted `msgstore.db` file, put it in the `db` directory of this application.

### 2. Media files
Copy and paste the whole `WhatsApp` directory with its subdirectories into the `public` directory.

### 3. Start the application
Run `rails server` and explore your messages on `localhost:3000`.
