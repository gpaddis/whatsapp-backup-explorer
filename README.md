# WhatsApp Backup Explorer

The database schema was generated with `rails db:schema:dump`. Some tables had to be dumped manually, since the command does not automatically recognize some of the fields in WhatsApp's SQLite database.

The models were autogenerated with [schema_to_scaffold](https://github.com/frenesim/schema_to_scaffold).
